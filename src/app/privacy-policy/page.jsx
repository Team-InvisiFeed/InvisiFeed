                      <p className="text-gray-300">
                        You, the Business User, are solely and exclusively responsible for the accuracy, legality, quality, integrity, and intellectual property ownership or right to use all Service Data You upload, create, or process using the Service. This includes, without limitation, the content of all invoices, the accuracy and validity of any GSTIN provided, and ensuring that You have obtained all necessary rights, permissions, and consents from Your End-Users to collect, share, and process their information (including PII) via the Service in compliance with all applicable laws (including data protection and privacy laws).

                      <p className="text-gray-300">
                        InvisiFeed provides a platform and tools for invoice and feedback management. We do not verify the authenticity of the transactions represented in the invoices, the identity of the Business Users beyond basic account verification, or the validity of GSTIN information provided by Users. <strong>InvisiFeed expressly disclaims any and all liability for any fraudulent, illegal, or unauthorized use of the Service by You or any third party.</strong> This includes, but is not limited to, the creation or distribution of fake or fraudulent invoices, the misuse of GSTIN information (whether fake, stolen, or otherwise improperly used), or any misrepresentation made by a Business User to their End-Users or any other party. You agree to indemnify and hold harmless InvisiFeed against any claims arising from Your misuse of the Service or Your violation of applicable laws or third-party rights.

                        While the feedback form is designed not to collect End-User PII directly, the ultimate anonymity depends on the End-User not including identifying information in free-text fields and the inherent limitations of internet communication (potential logging of IP addresses for technical reasons). We are not liable if an End-User voluntarily discloses PII within the feedback content.
