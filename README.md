## 📝 **Project Name: InvisiFeed**  
**Empowering businesses with authentic, anonymous feedback through secure QR-based invoicing.**  

---

## 🚀 **Project Overview**  
**InvisiFeed** is a web application designed to help businesses, freelancers, and service providers gather genuine and anonymous customer feedback using QR codes embedded in invoices. This system ensures that feedback remains unbiased and secure, promoting business growth through real insights.  

### 🌟 **How It Works:**  
1. **Business Side:**  
   - Business owners upload an invoice to the platform.  
   - The platform extracts the unique Order ID/Ref ID.  
   - A QR code is generated and embedded into the invoice.  
   - The QR-injected invoice is sent to the customer via email.  

2. **Customer Side:**  
   - The customer scans the QR code to provide feedback.  
   - AI generates feedback suggestions based on selected keywords (e.g., "Excellent Service," "Needs Improvement," etc.).  
   - Customers can submit custom feedback and star ratings.  
   - Feedback remains anonymous (Order ID not linked to feedback).  
   - Customers can regenerate the QR code and modify feedback once after verifying the invoice.  

3. **Business Dashboard:**  
   - View all anonymous feedback.  
   - Analyze performance with key metrics (average rating, growth %, etc.).  
   - Receive real-time notifications for new feedback.
